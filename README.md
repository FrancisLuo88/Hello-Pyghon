# Hello-Pyghon
just another repository

Hello human, this is another young man(forever young~),who wants to learn programming when he is 29.
It starts from python learning.
It takes a lot to start freshly at such an age, everyone konws this.
However,,, As other people can do this, so can I.
I hope to manage python programming in 5 years, and then transform to be a software and electronics engineer.
Best wishes!!!!
